# Nakatomi Daemon

This is daemon runs on a raspberry pi running an instance of [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/). It servers as the middle man between the MPD service itself, physical knobs and an LCD display. It is meant to drive the interface for this [Philco radio project](https://random-hackery.net/post/philco/).
